top_100_albums: A Django REST Framework (DRF) Practice Project.

This is a personal project aimed at developing my hands-on DRF skills. It is not
intended to be deployed to production.

The app consists of 3 Django models, their corresponding hyperlinked-serializers,
and viewsets and routers to enable customized CRUD functionality.

This is basically a work in progress and more advanced DRF features such as API versioning,
automatic schema generation and throttling will be added in due time.

Please submit any bugs or recommendations to mlh86.pk@outlook.com
